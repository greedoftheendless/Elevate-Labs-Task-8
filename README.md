**VPN Hands-On Experience and Research Summary**

VPN Chosen: Proton VPN (Free Plan)
Platform: Linux
1. Setup and Connection

To begin, I selected Proton VPN, a reputable and privacy-focused service known for its strong encryption standards and a reliable free tier. After downloading and installing the Proton VPN application on my Arch Linux system, I successfully created an account and connected to a server located in the Netherlands.
2. Verifying the VPN Connection

Once connected:

    My IP address changed, confirming that the VPN had successfully masked my original location.

    A lock icon appeared in the browser’s address bar while visiting websites, indicating that my connection was encrypted and secure.

    After disconnecting from the VPN, my original IP address returned, and I noticed a significant improvement in browsing speed, which is typical since VPN traffic takes a longer path.

3. Understanding VPN Technology

While using the VPN, I explored how these tools enhance privacy and protect data:

    Encryption: Most reliable VPNs—including Proton VPN—use AES-256 encryption, a military-grade standard used by banks and government agencies. This ensures that even if someone intercepts your internet traffic, it would be virtually impossible to decipher.

    VPN Protocols:

        OpenVPN: A widely used, well-established protocol known for its balance of speed and security.

        WireGuard: A newer protocol designed for performance and simplicity, offering faster speeds while maintaining robust security.

    Advanced Features: Some VPNs offer Multi-Hop routing, which channels your connection through multiple servers for an added layer of anonymity.

4. Summary: Benefits and Limitations of VPNs
✅ Benefits

    Privacy Protection: VPNs mask your real IP address, making it more difficult for websites, advertisers, or hackers to track your online activity.

    Encrypted Traffic: Especially vital on public Wi-Fi (airports, cafes), VPNs secure your data against interception.

    Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: VPNs allow access to content blocked or restricted in certain countries, including streaming platforms and websites.

    Circumventing Censorship: In regions with strict internet regulations, VPNs help users bypass filters and browse freely.

⚠️ Limitations

    Performance: Free VPNs often come with limited speeds, fewer server options, or data usage caps.

    Privacy Concerns: Some free VPNs may log user activity or show ads to monetize their service.

    No Full Protection: VPNs can’t protect you from phishing websites, malware downloads, or poor online hygiene.

    Streaming Compatibility: Certain streaming services block VPN traffic, making it difficult to access region-specific content on free VPNs.

    Website Access Issues: Some sites may detect and block VPN usage, limiting accessibility.

Conclusion

Using Proton VPN provided both practical experience and insight into how VPNs enhance online privacy. While they offer essential protection and freedom on the internet, it's important to recognize their limitations and use them alongside other cybersecurity best practices. For users who value privacy and frequently access public networks, a trusted VPN is a powerful tool—but not a silver bullet.
